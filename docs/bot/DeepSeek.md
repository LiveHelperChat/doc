title: Integrating DeepSeek into Live Helper Chat with tool calls support

Due to the following issue, I was unable to complete the example integration with tool calling:
https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/issues/15

Before proceeding, you will need the following:

*   An API Key from https://platform.deepseek.com/
*   A REST API configuration in Live Helper Chat
*   A Bot configuration in LHC

The remainder of this guide will be completed once the issue is resolved. In the meantime, you can follow the ChatGPT example, which works flawlessly.
