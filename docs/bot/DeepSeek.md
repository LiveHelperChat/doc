Because of the this issue I could not finish example of this integration with tool calling.
https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/issues/15

Before that you will need few things

* API Key https://platform.deepseek.com/
* Rest API configuration in Live Helper Chat
* Bot configuration in LHC

The rest will be finished once the issue is resolved. You can also just follow ChatGPT example which works flawlessly.
