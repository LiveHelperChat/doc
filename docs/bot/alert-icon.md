The Alert icon feature allows you to add an icon to chats handled by a bot in the chat list.

The bot configuration looks like this:

![](/img/bot/alert-icon.png)

Once this trigger is executed, you will see something like this. In this example, the chat has two alert icons added.

![](/img/bot/alert-icon-list.png)

See the [sample](bot/check-conditions.md) on how to add an alert icon if a visitor's message contains specific words.
