## Introduction

This article explains how to use the REST API response type in a bot. With this feature, you can integrate any third-party API without any coding.

In order to make it work, you need to set up two things:

* The REST API call itself
* A bot trigger that will use that call
* See [an example of integration](integrate-any-ai-without-coding.md)
* Also, your AI can return [JSON directly for execution](trigger-body.md).

## Rest API Call

The REST API call building window is built in such a way that you can execute almost any request you want.

![](/img/bot/rest-api.png?v=1)

## Fields Definition for REST API

### Name

Name for your own purposes.

### Description

Description for your own purposes.

### Host

This should be a non-changing URL part. To this part, the `Sub URL` part is always appended.

### Add request

This button adds new request options to this API. You can have as many requests as you want. The request name is visible in the trigger method choosing dropdown.

## Request fields

### Name of the request

Visible in the method choosing dropdown in the trigger.

![](/img/bot/rest-api-method.png)

### Method

The appropriate method type for the request.

### Sub URL

URL to append to the host. It can be one of the replaceable variables.

In this field URL can be `urlencode_{{args.chat.nick}}` or without escaped url `{{args.chat.id}}`. URL Encode should be used if URL contains spaces or in general, it's a query part of the URL.

![](/img/bot/rest-api-trigger.png)

### Params

In the `Params` section, you define arguments that should be accessible as `GET` parameters.

### Authorization

If you are using an authorized API, you can set up basic authorization methods there.

### Headers

These values will be added to the header. They are combined like this:

`<Key>: <value>`

### Body

The body can be sent either as `RAW`, also known as `JSON Body`, or as regular `POST` parameters.

### User parameters

These parameters can be entered directly in the bot trigger itself once the method is chosen.

If you choose `Body Param`, you can use this variable `Location/Key` as a replaceable variable in your body JSON content.

`{{<Location/Key>}}`

If you choose `Query` or `Body Post Param`, the key will be used as a post/get parameter directly.

In Rest API

![](/img/bot/user-parameter-rest-api.png)

In the trigger, it would look like

![](/img/bot/user-entered-parameter.png)

### Output parsing

Output parsing is dedicated to extracting useful variables from the API response.

#### Name
The name will be visible within the option to execute a specific trigger based on the response.

![](/img/bot/expected-output-name.png)

In the trigger, it will be visible here

![](/img/bot/response-found.png?v=2)

#### HTTP status code E.g 200,301,500

For this response to match, you can define the expected HTTP status code. It's optional. This way you can separate the success response from the failed one.

#### Response Location 1/2/3/4/5/6.

If you define a success location, it will parse the response as JSON and try to extract the specified attribute.

Examples of variable extraction:

`status` as location value would return `success`
```json
{
  "status": "success"
}
```

`response:location` as a location value would return `Lithuania`
```json
{
  "response": {
    "location" :  "Lithuania"
  }
}
```

`items:0:name` as a location value would return `Sub item name`

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "name" :  "Sub item name"
    }
  ]
}
```

`links:link:[type=forms]:url` as a location value would return an element where the type is forms

```json
{
    "links": {
        "link": [
            {
                "type": "prices",
                "url": {},
                "chat_message": "We do not have that information available online.   We could follow up with you directly to discuss."
            },
            {
                "type": "forms",
                "url": "https://livehelperchat.com",
                "chat_message": "You can view and download our forms on this page"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

##### Parsing array for the output

* `user_info:phones^implode=={n}` would output phones array combined with new line character.
* `user_info:phones^implode==[b]{item}[/b]{n}` would output phones array wrapper with bold and new line character

```json
{
    "user_info": {
        "phones": [
            "111111",
            "222222"
        ]
    }
}
```

##### Parsing XML for the output

when you parse xml you should omit first tag and start from the second tag:
* use `pin:value`, NOT `response:pin:value`

```json
<response> 
  <pin> 
    <value>2222</value> 
  </pin>
  ....
</response>
```


#### Conditions checking

Sometimes it makes sense to check was something found based on response attribute. So you can define condition to check.

Here we expect that `status` value would be success.

![](/img/bot/rest-api-conditions.png)

JSON should look like this

```json
{
  "status": "success"
}
```

#### Meta msg location.

Here we can extract meta_msg if you provide Live Helper Chat compatible JSON response. Meta message will be used in chosen response trigger [**text message**] if this trigger does not have any meta message information.

```json
{
    "msg": "Standard message text from REST API",
    "meta_msg": {
        "content": {
            "quick_replies": [
                {
                    "type": "button",
                    "content": {
                        "name": "Rest API Button",
                        "payload": "rest_api_button"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

In order for rest API to receive these clicks you should also check in trigger [Default for unknown button click](triggers.md#trigger)

:::tip
Each trigger at the bottom has `Show code` button. This code is supported **only** by [`Execute trigger body`](trigger-body.md) response type. If you just want to build trigger and get code for response and reuse it, it's the response type you should use instead.
:::

### Conditions

Only if these conditions are met we will send Rest API request. Usefull in webhook cases.

Let say you want to send request only if chat happened with a bot?

Condition for that chat could look like

![](/img/bot/bot-closed-chat.png)

In case you want to send Rest API only if user message is not empty sample would look like

> {{msg_clean_lowercase}} != // Do not enter anything

### Polling

If you expect that the response will be delayed, you can set up polling. This way, the bot will keep checking the response until it matches one of the output combinations.

While doing, that web-server is keeping connection alive, which is not ideal for web application. It's better to use php-resque extension for that and have it happening in the background.

Sample bot and Rest-API https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/chatGPT/tree/main/doc/assistant for ChatGPT integration.

### Streaming

Streaming allows to show visitor while tokens are generated on ChatGPT or any other platform which supports streaming.

* `Streaming event type field` - In ChatGPT case it's returning `event: event.type` type response and `data: ` afterwards.

#### Requirements

 * You have to have a background worker running. [lhc-php-resque](https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/lhc-php-resque) extension is optional but highly recommended. Otherwise you will be keeping connection to your web server.
 * [NodeJS-Helper](https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/NodeJS-Helper) server running. It is required.
 * Before sending Rest API call in your bot make sure. Last message is a `Send typing` message. We use typing message indicator and fill its content with streaming content.

#### Output parsing

* `Output is matched only if event is this type.` If we want to match specific event for specific `Output combination` we can set a filter for that. `MessageReceived` event as example is expecting `thread.message.delta` as an example. 
* If this output combination result should be streamed you can check `Stream this output` checkbox. This way it will be streamed to the visitor.
* `Execute trigger on matched content. Stream will continue afterwards.` - If you want just execute trigger and flow is expected to continue check this option. `RunCreated` event as example is expecting `thread.run.created` as an example and expecting stream to continue. Messages will come afterward.
* `If matched use response as final response.` - If this output is matched it's response should be set as a final response. This happens in `RequiresAction` event as an example. It's expecting `thread.run.requires_action` as an example.
* `Stream content as HTML.` - If you want to stream content as HTML. We will render full HTML before feeding it to widget.
  * This should be checked for `ScheduleRun -> MessageReceived (output combination)` and `ToolCallCompleted -> MessageReceived (output combination)` events.

Sample bot and Rest-API https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/chatGPT/tree/main/doc/assistant_stream for ChatGPT integration.

#### Plain streaming

This is sample how to stream plain text to the visitor if API always is streaming `data: ` content.

 * Stream must follow `data: json_content` format E.g `data: {"delta":"text chunk"}`
 * Check `Streaming` checkbox in Rest API configuration
 * `Output parsing` Should have at-least one combination defined.

Output parsing can look like this.

![](/img/bot/plain_streaming.png)

Body payload can look like this just

![](/img/bot/rest-api-body-stream.png)

That's all your need to have in your Rest API configuration.

Trigger in bot can look like this.

![](/img/bot/streaming-bot.png)

Show response trigger content

![](/img/bot/show-response-stream.png)

## Replaceable variables

Rest API in value fields you can use these replaceable variables. These variables by default are already in json format with quotes. 

All chat messages. These combinations are usefully in case you are implementing sentiment analysis and want for example determine the sentiment of operator/visitor or both messages:

You can quickly explore all possible chat attributes by clicking `Explore possible chat attributes directly.` link in Rest API builder interface next to `Add request` button. This option is also available in `Audit Logs` section.

![](/img/bot/chat-attributes.png)

Single messages

* `{{msg}}` - user/operator message.
* `{{msg_lowercase}}` - user/operator message. **Lowercase version**.
* `{{msg_url}}` - user/operator message will contain links instead of bbcode tags.
* `{{msg_url_lowercase}}` - user/operator message will contain links instead of bbcode tags. **Lowercase version**.
* `{{msg_clean}}` - user/operator message without `[file=616_6f13fafc726e119f5a0a3f49221b45f7]` in it's body if it's the only content in message.
* `{{msg_clean_lowercase}}` - user/operator message without `[file=616_6f13fafc726e119f5a0a3f49221b45f7]` in it's body if it's the only content in message. **Lowercase version**.
* `{{msg_html}}` - msg in HTML format
* `{{msg_html_lowercase}}` - msg in HTML format lowercase
* `{{msg_html_nobr}}` - msg in HTML format without `<br />` tags. Presently used in telegram integration.
* `{{msg_html_lowercase_nobr}}` - msg in HTML format lowercase without `<br />` tags.
* `{{custom_args_1}}` - comes from trigger definition `Custom argument for the Rest API Call` field from bot trigger.

All messages at once

* `{{msg_all_since_transfer_content}}` - Messages since chat was transferred to operator. All messages without `[<date>] [<nick>]` prefix within each message. System messages are not printed.
* `{{msg_all_op_msg_content}}` - All operator messages in the chat. All messages without `[<date>] [<nick>]` prefix within each message.
* `{{msg_all_vis_msg_content}}` - All visitor messages in the chat. All messages without `[<date>] [<nick>]` prefix within each message.
* `{{msg_all_vis_since_transfer_content}}` - All visitor messages in the chat since operator took over the chat. All messages without `[<date>] [<nick>]` prefix within each message.
* `{{msg_all}}` - all chat messages.
* `{{msg_all_conversation}}` - all chat messages without system and whisper messages.
* `{{msg_items}}` - all chat messages objects encoded in JSON. Just do `json_decode` on passed variable
* `{{msg_all_html}}` - all chat messages rendered as HTML. You might need to style classes.
* `{{msg_all_content}}` - all messages without `[<date>] [<nick>]` prefix within each message. System messages are not printed.
* `{{media_all}}` - array of files attached `[file...` syntax.
* `{{media_all_links}}` - plain text with structure of 
```
http://example.com/link/to/file_1.pdf [file_1.pdf]
http://example.com/link/to/file_2.pdf [file_2.pdf]
```
* `{{media_all_links_raw}}` - plain text with structure of 
```
http://example.com/link/to/file_1.pdf
http://example.com/link/to/file_2.pdf 
```

* `{if_previous_visitor_messages}{"content":{{previous_visitor_messages_url__100__1}},"role":"user"},{/if_previous_visitor_messages}` print last 100 messages if there is any. We print here only visitor last 100 messages. We skip very first message with `1` as a second argument. Offset in other words. It's an optional argument.

Reply to scenario

```
{reply_to},"context": { "message_id":  {{iwh_msg_id}}  }{/reply_to}
```

For this to work you have to 

* Enter `Messages ID` in icoming webhooks `Message related attributes`
* Enter `Reply to message ID` in icoming webhooks `Message related attributes` so we will know to which message visitor is replying.
* In `Rest API Calls` section in `Remote Message ID` enter attribute location of send message.
 
 Reply to messages are support in official facebook whatsapp integration. So take a look there just.

### Magic prefixes for replaceable variables

There are three types of magic prefixes they apply to all replaceable variables and only to body,files payload.

 * `raw_<replaceable_variable>` - will return value without wrapping quotes where content will be a valid JSON string. E.g `raw_{{lhc.nick}}`, etc. `raw_{{args.chat.id}}`
 * `sensitive_<replaceable_variable>` - content of variable will be processed using `Messages content protection` rules.
 * `raw_sensitive__<replaceable_variable>` - content of variable will be processed using `Messages content protection` rules and wrapping quotes will be removed content will be a valid JSON string.

Other:

* `{{ip}}` - visitor ip. If you are running background worker this value will be localhost.
* `{{footprint}}` - last 25 viewed pages url's
* `{{chat_id}}` - chat ID
* `{{timestamp}}` - unix timestamp
* `{{date_utc}}` - date in full format in UTC timezone. E.g `2024-11-20 12:27:03 UTC.`
* `{{subject_ids}}` - array of subject id's assigned to chat
* `{{subject_list}}` - array of subjects objects with all attributes
* `{{subject_list_names}}` - string of subject names imploded by comma 
* `{{survey}}` - filled chat surveys

Attributes usefull for sending content in `Sub URL for file`

* `{{file_body}}` - base64 encoded file content `'data:'.$mediaFile->type.';base64,'.base64_encode(file_get_contents($mediaFile->file_path_server));`
* `{{file_url}}` - url to download file directly
* `{{file_name}}` - uploaded file name from operator

Additional attribute you can use for `Sub URL for file` and `If you are sending file you can have a different body content`

* `{file_api}your request body in case it's a file{/file_api}`
* `{image_api}your request body in case it's an image{/image_api}` - 'image/jpeg','image/png','image/gif'
* `{vodeo_api}your request body in case it's an image{/vodeo_api}` - 'video/mp4'

You can have dynamic variable based on file extension by using `{api_by_ext__<file_type>_<other_file_type>}sendVoice{/api_by_ext}` E.g

* `{api_by_ext__ogg}sendVoice{/api_by_ext}` - use `sendVoice` value if media file extension is `ogg`
* `{api_by_ext__mp3_m4a}sendAudio{/api_by_ext}` use `sendAudio` value if media file extension is `mp3` or `m4a`

Same pattern has to be defined in `Sub URL for file` and `If you are sending file you can have a different body content` fields.

Example from telegram. `Sub URL for file` file url
```
/bot{{args.chat.incoming_chat.incoming_dynamic_array.access_token}}/{api_by_ext__ogg}sendVoice{/api_by_ext}{api_by_ext__mp3_m4a}sendAudio{/api_by_ext}{api_by_ext__mp4}sendVideo{/api_by_ext}{image_api}sendPhoto{/image_api}{file_api}sendDocument{/file_api}
````

Example from telegram.  `If you are sending file you can have a different body content` file content

```
{
   "chat_id":{{args.chat.incoming_chat.chat_external_id}},
   "{api_by_ext__ogg}voice{/api_by_ext}{api_by_ext__mp3_m4a}audio{/api_by_ext}{api_by_ext__mp4}video{/api_by_ext}{file_api}document{/file_api}{image_api}photo{/image_api}":{{file_url}}
}
```

* `{not_empty__*}body if variable is not empty{/not_empty}` variable `{{msg_url}}` has to be not empty. In this scenario we send ChatGPT additional message only if it's not empty.
* As for check you can use any replaceable variables like `{{msg_url}}` etc.
```json
{
    "assistant_id": "asst_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
    "parallel_tool_calls": false
    {not_empty__msg_url},"additional_messages" : [{"role" : "user", "content" :  {{msg_url}} }]{/not_empty}
}
```

* `{is_empty__*}body if variable is empty{/is_empty}` variable `{{msg_url}}` has to be not empty. In this scenario we send ChatGPT additional message only if it's not empty.
* As for check you can use any replaceable variables like `{{msg_url}}` etc. In below exampel we check if `is_logged` variable is not set. We instruct Chat GPT do not call any functions and ask user to login.
```json
{
  "assistant_id": "asst_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "parallel_tool_calls": false
{is_empty__args.chat.chat_variables_array.is_logged}
,"tools":[]
, "additional_instructions":"Visitor is not logged in and functions calls are not enable to him. You can answer questions only from documentation. Ask him to login to get personal account information. You can get personal information once visitor is logged in."
{/is_empty}
{not_empty__msg_url},"additional_messages" : [{"role" : "user", "content" :  {{msg_url}} }]{/not_empty}
}
```

Additional attributes you can use 

* `{interactive_api}quick reply buttons wrapper{/interactive_api}`
* `{button_template}quick reply individual button template{/button_template}`
* `{is_button}"button"{/is_button}` - in case quick reply button is a button
* `{is_url}"url"{/is_url}` - in case quick reply button is an url
* `{{rest_api_button}}` - custom content from bot builder `Rest API button custom content.` field
* `{{button_payload}}` - either lhc genrared internal payload for the trigger execution or just an URL
* `{{button_title}}` - quick reply button title

```

Main chat attributes. You can access only first level attributes.

* `{{lhc.nick}}` - visitor nick
* `{{lhc.email}}` - e-mail
* `{{lhc.department}}` - department name
* `{{lhc.dep_id}}` - department ID
* `{{lhc.<any chat attribute>}}` - all possible attributes you can find [https://api.livehelperchat.com](https://api.livehelperchat.com) at the bottom under `Models > Chat` also you can access any dynamic attribute like [{{lhc.department_name}}](https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/livehelperchat/blob/master/lhc_web/lib/models/lhchat/erlhcoreclassmodelchat.php#L430).

To access custom passed variables or fields.

* `{{lhc.add.<additional variable key/identifier>}}` - these values you are passing additionaly. It's either `Field identifier` from `Start a chat form settings > Custom fields` or if you are passing manually it's `name` attribute. If you put `Field identifier` value as `gender` in `Start a chat form settings > Custom fields`. In Rest API Call you can access this field like `{{lhc.add.gender}}`
* `{{lhc.var.<chat variable key>}}` - these values can be set using extensions etc. It's data is taken by `json_decode` function from `chat_variables` column value. This column stores JSON as `{<key> : <value>,..}`. Usually in this column extensions stores their own data.
* `{{media}}` - Will hold JSON encoded related files to send message.

```json
[
  {
    "id": 636,
    "size": 10007,
    "upload_name": "image.png",
    "type": "image/png",
    "extension": "png",
    "hash": "4bcda854ef4f27e8b4003b42c84f1cb6",
    "url": "https://devmysql.livehelperchat.com/file/downloadfile/636/4bcda854ef4f27e8b4003b42c84f1cb6"
  }
]
```

Dynamic attributes extraction. You can go as deep as you want.  

* `{{args.<any argument attribute>.<any subargument attribute>}}` - if you are implementing [webhooks](../development/webhooks.md) most likely you will be using this as placeholder.
* `{{args.chat.department.identifier}}` - This way you can access any chat and child object attributes. In this example department identifier. 
* `{{args.chat.department}}` - you can pass even all department object.
* `{{args.chat.chat_variables_array.order_id}}` - access `order_id` if field is defined as `This variable is invisible for operator and will be stored in chat_variables attribute`
* `{{args.chat.id}}` [Chat object](https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/livehelperchat/blob/master/lhc_web/lib/models/lhchat/erlhcoreclassmodelchat.php#L196) also see `__get` method for magic attributes like
  * `department` or `user` 
    * `{{args.chat.user.name_support}}` name visible in the widget or 
    * `{{args.chat.user.name_official}}` name visible in the back office
* `{{args.arg_1}}` - commands arguments

Incoming chat attributes. This is usefull if you want to access to payload attribute of `Incoming webhook` created chat.

* `{{args.chat.incoming_chat.chat_external_id}}` - external chat id
* `{{args.chat.incoming_chat.chat_external_first}}` - first part of chat external if two fields are used
* `{{args.chat.incoming_chat.chat_external_last}}` - last part of chat external if two fields are used
* `{{args.chat.incoming_chat.payload_array.*}}` - you can access any first payload attribute. E.g session Id
* `{{args.chat.incoming_chat.incoming.attributes.<you defined key in attribtues of incoming webhook>}}` - you can use this as placeholder for `Sub URL` or `Sub URL for file`. Just leave empty host attribute.
* `{{args.chat.incoming_chat.incoming.scope}}` - you can access any attribute of incoming webhook definition
* `{{args.msg_text}}` - unknown button click payload value

All possible models attributes you can find [https://api.livehelperchat.com](https://api.livehelperchat.com) at the bottom under `Models > Chat`

These are the main classes

* [`args.chat.<attr>`](https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/livehelperchat/blob/master/lhc_web/lib/models/lhchat/erlhcoreclassmodelchat.php)
* [`args.chat.user.<attr>`](https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/livehelperchat/blob/master/lhc_web/lib/models/lhuser/erlhcoreclassmodeluser.php)
* [`args.chat.department.<attr>`](https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/livehelperchat/blob/master/lhc_web/lib/models/lhdepartament/erlhcoreclassmodeldepartament.php)
* [`args.chat.incoming_chat.<attr>`](https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/livehelperchat/blob/master/lhc_web/lib/models/lhchat/erlhcoreclassmodelchatincoming.php)
* [`args.chat.incoming_chat.incoming.<attr>`](https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/livehelperchat/blob/master/lhc_web/lib/models/lhchat/erlhcoreclassmodelchatincomingwebhook.php)

All classes can be found [here](https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/livehelperchat/tree/master/lhc_web/lib/models)

Example

So your JSON body in rest API can look like
```
{
    "msg":{{msg}}, // OR {{msg_clean}}
    "query":{{query}},
    "media":{{media}},
    "subject_ids": {{subject_ids}} 
}
```

Replaceable variables works only in
 * Params
 * Body
 * Headers

## Trigger workflow

In trigger once everything is setup it will look like this.

![](/img/bot/rest-api-trigger-sample.png)

Fields description

* `Rest API` - it's our main Rest API `Name` we are working with
* `Method` - it's our `Name of the request` from Rest API building window.
* `User entered parameter` - it's just defined parameter which is coming from Rest API builder window `User parameters` tab.
* `Execute trigger for [UUID Set]` - It's defined output parsing option which we defined in Rest API `Output parsing` tab.
* `Default trigger to execute` - if we did not found any matching output combination this trigger will be executed.
* `Send Rest API Call in the background.` - by default `Rest API` calls are send as soon visitor sends a message, they are happening on same request. This can lead to a problems if Rest API is slow. We can send Rest API calls in the background, but for that you have to be running [lhc-php-resque](https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/lhc-php-resque) extension. You won't need to code anything just setup extension itself.
* `Process on next visitor message` - this call will be executed only on next visitor message. Usefull in case you want to check only for specific actions.
* `Save response as system message` - will save a message as system message. It will be invisible for the visitor.
* `Do not save response.` - usefull in case you want to execute a call, but do not save any related information.
* `Custom argument for the Rest API Call` - this content can be reached via Rest API call directly through `{{custom_args_1}}` var. It's usefull in ChatGPT integration
   * If your Rest API fails you can just have something like this `{"success":false,"reason":"service is temporrary offline, try after 5 minutes"}`
   * Or you can forward direct response from Your Rest API `{"success":true,"list":{content_1}}` Take a look https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/chatGPT

## Output variables in triggers

Use can use these variables in your text triggers response text.

* `{content_1}`
* `{content_2}`
* `{content_3}`
* `{content_4}`
* `{content_5}`
* `{content_6}`
* `{http_code}` - https status code returned from request
* `{http_error}` - additional error explanation from `curl_error($ch);`
* `{content_raw}` - raw response returned from Rest API call without any parsing
* `{http_data}` - Request parameters used for rest api call.

## How to iterate through response if `content_[n]` holds an array?

Text message content can look like this. Your iterable object will be available under `{args.item.<internal property of you object>` attribute.

```
{foreach=content_1}
- {args.item.mail_asesor}
{/foreach}
```

There variables can be used in most of the response types including

* [Set main chat attribute](bot/update-current-chat.md#update-main-chat-attribute) for setting `email`, `nick`, `phone` etc.
* [Set additional chat attribute](bot/update-current-chat.md#set-chat-additional-attribute-visible-by-operator) for custom chat attributes
* [Text responses](bot/text.md#replaceable-variables) for showing visitor information for the user itself. E.g package location

## How to pass in what language chat is going?

Best way is just to pass `{{args.chat.chat_locale}}` if customer is chatting in any other language than english, and you pass `lang` argument it's value will be always `content_language` attribute from `siteaccess` settings.

* https://github.com/LiveHelperChat/livehelperchat/blob/master/lhc_web/settings/settings.ini.default.php#L154
* If you wish to pass strictly `en` on english language you can just define another `siteacess` for english language and make it default. Then in embed code pass `eng/` as language. Live Helper Chat will see it's not the default `siteacess` and will set chat locale to siteacess `content_langauge` value.

## How to find out problems with Rest API

### Audit log

 * Newer version has option in Rest API configuration check `Log all request and their responses in audit log.`
 * After that you will see all request made by your chosen Rest API in Audit log

### Triggers

 * Setup output combination for success call.
 * In default response have two text messages as response

In rest api define trigger for `Unknown` unmatched output combination

In response have something like this. Pay attention second text message is send as system message.

## How to handle API Errors?

There is two ways to handle API errors.
 * Set fallback trigger on `Default trigger to execute`. If API works correctly your defined output combination will be executed.
 * You can just in your `Rest-API` configuration check `Log all request and their responses in audit log.` or `Log all request and their responses as system messages.`. This way you will see all requests made by your Rest API in Audit log.
