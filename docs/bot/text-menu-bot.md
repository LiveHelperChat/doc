title: Making bot navigation using only text messages
sidebar_label: Text menu

This is usefull if you are integrating third party services. Like whatsapp, sms chat.

Idea is to give user text menu to choose actions from.

Workflow itself would look like this.

![](/img/bot/text-menu.png)

## Bot workflow

We will use these bot responses

1. Text message
2. Collect custom attribute
3. Check for conditions to proceed

![](/img/bot/text-menu-bot.png)

You can download bot source [here](/img/bot/ai/text-bot.json) (Click right mouse button and choose `Save link as...`). Afterwards you can just import a file.
