This approach is useful when integrating with third-party services like WhatsApp or SMS chat.

The idea is to provide the user with a text-based menu to select actions.

The workflow would look like this:

![](/img/bot/text-menu.png)

## Bot workflow

We will use the following bot responses:

1.  Text message
2.  Collect custom attribute
3.  Check conditions to proceed

![](/img/bot/text-menu-bot.png)

You can download the bot source [here](/img/bot/ai/text-bot.json?v=2) (right-click and choose "Save link as..."). After downloading, you can import the file.
