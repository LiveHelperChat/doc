## Introduction

A "participant" refers to an agent who engages in a chat. By default, statistics are based on the chat's owner. However, a chat can be transferred to multiple agents during its lifetime. Therefore, a participant is any agent who has participated in a chat.

## Where can participant statistics be seen?

If you click "Edit chat" in the debug window, you will see participant information, which is subsequently used in the [statistic](chat/statistic.mdx#number-of-chats-by-user-participant).

Participant statistics are used in [agent statistics](chat/statistic.mdx#agents-statistic).
