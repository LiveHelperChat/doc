If you have large number of chats I would suggest to use ElasticSearch plugin for statistic generation. In any case with relative small number of chats default functionality also works. Here are all charts you can generate.

## Statistic

Main statistic tab. These charts are grouped by month by default. If you want grouping by day use `Chats statistic` tab.

## Terminology

Attributes used for closing chat

* `lsync` - time last time we saw a visitor.
* `pnd_time` - time since chat become pending. This can be different than chat start time. (Bot transfer chat to pending state)
* `wait_time` - how long visitor waited before chat was accepted
* `user_id` - operator id

### Transfer happened

* Chat has transfer set `transfer_uid`
* Chat has owner set `user_id`
* Operator who transferred and chat owner is not the same

Rule in the code look slike
```
(`lh_chat`.`transfer_uid` > 0 AND `lh_chat`.`transfer_uid` != `lh_chat`.`user_id`)
```

### Abandoned chat

Rule in the code looks like
```
((`lsync` < (`pnd_time` + `wait_time`) AND `wait_time` > 1) OR  (`lsync` > (`pnd_time` + `wait_time`) AND `wait_time` > 1 AND `user_id` = 0))
```

* Last time we saw a visitor is less than the time chat was accepted and wait time was longer than 1 second. Chat's where only bot participated wait time is equal to 1. That's why we have to check only wait time > 1
* Last time we saw visitor is greater than wait time but user is not assigned to a chat.

### Dropped chat

Rule in the code looks like.

```
(`lsync` > (`pnd_time` + `wait_time`) AND `has_unread_op_messages` = 1 AND `user_id` > 0)
```

* Chat was accepted by operator
* Visitor was seen after chat was accepted
* Chat has unread operator messages

### Chat numbers by status

Usefull to see general number of chats.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/chats-numbers-by-status.jpg')} />

### Unanswered chat numbers

If visitor writes a message and chat is pending. Chat becomes unanswered.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/unanswered.jpg')} />

Chat remains unanswered even if operator accepts a chat if

* Visitor has closed the chat
* From last message sync passed more than 60 seconds on desktop devices OR more than 240 seconds on mobile devices.

As second condition can be false positive. E.g Visitor just left the chat and operator accepted a chat this flag would be removed.

It's recommended to check just filter `Abandoned chat`

### Message types

Let's you see what types of messages were most popular.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/message-types.jpg')} />

### Number of Thumbs Up/Down

Displays what operators received most thumbs up

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/thumbs-up.jpg')} />

Displays what operators received most thumbs down

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/thumbs-down.jpg')} />

### Average number of chats & peak per hour

Shows maximum chats per hour logged.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/peak-chats-per-hour.jpg')} />

### Number of chats per hour, average chat duration 08 m. 32 s.

#### Chat duration is calculation

Chat duration is calculated by summarising time spend between message if they do not exceed defined thresholds.

* How long operator can wait for message from visitor before time between messages are ignored. Values in minutes. (4 minutes default)
* How long visitor can wait for message from operator before time between messages are ignored. Values in minutes. (10 minutes default)

These values can be changed in `Chat configuration -> Misc`

Chart example

Shows total number of chats logged per hour for selected period. In this case it was for two weeks.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/chats-per-hour.jpg')} />

### Number of chats by department

This way you can know which department had largest number of chats.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/chats-by-department.jpg')} />

### Unique group field records grouped by date

Unique nick's grouped by date. With extension you can add more fields you would like to group by.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/unique-records.jpg')} />

### Proactive chats number vs visitors initiated

From this chart you can see how many chats were initiated by proactive invitation and how many started by a visitor.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/proactive-vs-visitor-initiated.jpg')} />

### Number of chats by country

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/chats-by-country.jpg')} />

### Average wait time in seconds (maximum of 10 minutes)

Wait time being calculated by how long visitor waiting for chat becoming active after it became pending.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/average-wait-time.jpg')} />

### AVG visitor wait time by operator

You can see which operator is accepting chats with delay once chat being assigned to hom for example. If queue is big chat in any case would have longer wait time.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/wait-time-by-operator.jpg')} />

### Chats number grouped by date and group field

In this chart, if you group by nick, you can see what visitor chatted the most. If you do not allow visitor enter nick and prefill it's good way to know what visitor had biggest number of chats.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/group-by-nick-date.jpg')} />

### Number of chats by subject

If you are using subjects later you can generate graph like this.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/chats-by-subject.jpg')} />

### Number of messages by user

You can see what operator had send biggest number of message for selection period of time.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/messages-by-operator.jpg')} />

### Number of chats by user

You can see what operator had biggest number of chats for selection period. 0 in this chart means bot. So you can see how many chats were served directly by bot.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/chats-by-opeator.jpg')} />

### Number of chats by transfer operator

* It shows operator and number of transfers he did.
* While generating chart I suggest to choose in filters `Transfer happened` so only real transfers will be presented.
* If `Transfer happened` option is not chosen First column will be all chats without transfer. We are grouping by operator who transferred and because it's none. It will have a highest number of records.
* If you choose `Chats with an operator` we will make sure that chat owner and operator who transferred will be set. But they can match. That's the only difference from `Transfer happened`

### Average chat duration by user in seconds

You can see what operator takes longest time chatting with visitor. It means that his performance can be improved. This report can be downloaded also.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/chat-duration-by-operator.jpg')} />

## Chats statistic

The main difference between above chats and charts in `Chats statistic` section charts in this section is can be grouped by day.

### Chat numbers by status

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/chats-by-day.jpg')} />

## Total statistic

It's lifetime statistic. If you are using archive functionality. This statistic does not include chats from archives.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/total-statistic.jpg')} />

## Last 24h statistics

You can get basic last 24 hours statistic in this section.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/last-24-hours.jpg')} />

## Agents statistic

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/operators-statistic.jpg')} />

Clicking on `Time online (sum of time spend online)` will give you log of operator online/offline time.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/online-offline-time.jpg')} />

## Performance

This will represent general performance and will let you know how many chats were abandoned before they even got accepted.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/general-performance.jpg')} />

To optimise operators performance and avoid operator accepting abandoned chats it's recommended to [setup automatic](automatic-closing-purging.md) chat closing for

`Automatically close pending chats where visitor has left a chat. Timeout in minutes, last activity by visitor desktop timeout,mobile timeout.`

## Departments

If you have running [department availability cronjob](development/cronjob.md#department-availability-cronjob) you will be able to generate this chart.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/department-stats.jpg')} />

## Visitors

These charts can take really long to generate so make sure you choose quite short period of time day/week.

### Cities

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/visitors-city.jpg')} />

### Countries

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/visitors-country.jpg')} />

### New visitors

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/new-visitors.jpg')} />

### Returning visitors

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/returning-visitors.jpg')} />

## Pending VS Online

This chart is available only if you are using ElasticSearch

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/pending-vs-online.jpg')} />

## Configuration

In this section you can choose what charts should be checked by default for generation.

<Image img={require('../../static/img/statistic/charts-configuration.jpg')} />

:::tip
In order operator to see all departments statistic even the ones operator do not belong to, he has to have these permissions:

`'lhdepartment', 'see_all'` and `'lhuser', 'see_all'`
:::

## Permissions

To view statistic

> 'lhstatistic','viewstatistic'

To allow operator export statistic in XLS. At the moment only department statistic can be exported in XLS.

> 'lhstatistic','exportxls'

To allow operator configure statistic default charts

> 'lhstatistic','configuration'
