![](/img/dashboard/departments-stats.png?v=2)

Columns and their meanings

* `Pending chats` - number of pending chats department/department group has
* `Active chats` - number of actives chats department/department group has
* `Bot chats` - number of active bot chats
* `Load columns` - current status of department load based on max chats operators can have.
    * It's value is calculated  by `hard limit - active chats (soft limit - active chats)`
    * `Hard limit` - is the sum of max chats value of **logged** operators OR the operators who were online in last 10 minutes
    * `Active chats` - number of active chats in department or department group
    * `Soft limit` - is the sum of max chats of operators who were **active** during last **10** minutes.
* `Operators online` - Total operators active in backend (last 10 min). (Number) is count of those also in online status.

Operator also can click on `Load column` and see detailed load statistic.

![](/img/dashboard/load-modal.png)

> Statistics will be updated when first event happen after change of settings (es. user chat limits)
> Operator has to be assigned explicitly to department or department group
> Operator should have limits set (E.g Max Chats)

Statistics are updated in the following scenarios:

* New chat has started — the relevant department is updated
* Chat has been closed/assigned/transferred to another department

Operators' statistics are **NOT** updated if an operator goes online/offline until some action happens with a department-related chat!

Statistics can be updated manually by running [department statistic cronjob](development/cronjob.md#department-statistic-cronjob).
