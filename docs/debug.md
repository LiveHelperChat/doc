In order to see what templates what used in page render you have to enable debug output in settings/settings.ini.php file

```
'debug_output' => true,
```

Do not forget that to see all used template you have to disable cache also. 

```
'templatecache' => true,
'templatecompile' => true,
'modulecompile' => true,
```

    * <used_design>
* `doc` (Release documentation)
* `extension` (All extensions goes here)
* `ezcomponents`
* `lib` (core of the framework)
    * `autoloads`
        * `lhcore_autoload.php` (Main application autoload file)

* `models` (Folder contains application models clases)
* `modules` (There goes application modules.)
* `pos` (Represents eZ Components pos, persistent object talbles definitions)

## How to log javascript errors?

Go to `System configuration > Audit (Configuration)` and enable `Log javascript errors` after that. If there is any JS error it will be logged to `System configuration > Audit (Audit Logs)`. 

You can search for javascript errors by these search attributes.

 * Category - `js`
 * Source - `lhc`

Using javascript log. Most of the time compiled js file has map file E.g 

If error as an example happened in

`https://demo.livehelperchat.com/design/defaulttheme/js/widgetv2/index.js`

there will be also source map file 

`https://demo.livehelperchat.com/design/defaulttheme/js/widgetv2/index.js.map`

Afterwards you can just use https://jimbly.github.io/stackwalker/index.html to find exact error.

As in above example you see that widget styles can be overrided editing `customtheme/css/widget_override.css` file. Debug shows all searched files during page load. If you want to edit [invitation to chat green block](https://livehelperchat.com/need-help-tool-tip-configuration-280a.html) the easiest way to do that is just override styles using !important flag. These styles should be in your site CSS not widget_override.css file.
