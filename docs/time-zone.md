After installing the application, you should set your time zone. If you do not set a time zone, Live Helper Chat will use the server's time zone. If you are using [online hours](department/department.md#automate-online-hours) for a department, it will use the time zone defined here.

Operators can also set their own personal time zone in their user account page.
