Access can be granted to users to allow them to edit their settings. This access is managed through roles, which will be explained in the modules and functions chapter. The standard account editing window is shown below.

Below, a user can see their assigned departments. If a user does not have permission to change their account, the checkbox is disabled. If a user has permission to access all departments, a message indicates that they can see all department chats, and no additional department assignment is needed.

A new user can be created from the users list window by clicking the add icon.

During the new user creation process, departments can be immediately assigned to the user.

For an account to be fully functional, the user must be assigned to a group. This can be done from the group editing window.

The user editing window is similar to the new user window.

Users can be deleted in the same way as groups, roles, etc., by clicking the delete icon in the user list window.
